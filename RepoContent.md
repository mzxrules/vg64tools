# Introduction #

Our repository contains both tools for N64 games and code the games themselves can use.




# Code for games #
Hacks and toolchains for changing how games work.

## GNU Toolchain ##
Scripts used to set up the MIPS-GCC toolchain used to compile C hacks for N64 games.

## toolmode ##
Hack for the Debugger's version of OoT Master Quest that allows the user to make changes in-game and save those changes to the gamesave, so they appear the next time the user goes to the area the made the changes in.<br>

<h2>z64-actors</h2>
Actors from the Debugger's build of OoT Master Quest that are or are being re-written in C.<br>
<h3>En_Bird</h3>
Beta bird. Successfully re-written in C, though the animation plays a bit fast. A branch of it flies in a broken circle.<br>
<h3>En_Dodojr</h3>
Baby dodongo. Very little progress thus far, only a few functions successfully work in C.<br>
<h2>z64actor</h2>
Not to be confused with z64-actors, this is a hack for the 1.0 version of OoT that can spawn actors on demand.<br>
<h2>z64vr</h2>
A hack for the Debugger's version of OoT Master Quest that replaces all vowels in in-game dialog to "o"s.<br>
